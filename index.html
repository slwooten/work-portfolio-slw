                        <p>Hello! My name is Seth Wooten. First, I'd like to say thank you for <span id="little-header">...[Read more]</span > <span id="little-p" class="hide">taking the time to check out my portfolio. This is where you'll find some information about me, the projects I've worked on, links to those projects, and much more. Now for a little bit about me. I was born in Statesville, NC and grew up about 25 minutes north of Statesville in a town called Hamptonville. I spent my entire childhood living there with my mom, dad, and older brother. I graduated from North Iredell High School in the year of 2017 and attended Mitchell Community College where I obtained an Associate's Degree. I then transfered to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte where I graduated in the winter of 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing.</span></p>
