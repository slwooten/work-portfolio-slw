                <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Seth Wooten. First, I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to check out my
                    portfolio. This is where you'll find some information about me, the projects I've worked on, links
                    to those projects, and much more. Now for a little bit about me. I was born in Statesville, NC and
                    grew up about 25 minutes north of Statesville in a town called Hamptonville. I spent my entire
                    childhood living there with my mom, dad, and older brother. I graduated from North Iredell High
                    School in the year of 2017 and attended Mitchell Community College where I obtained an Associate's
                    Degree. I then transfered to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte where I graduated in the
                    winter of 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing.</p>
                <h3>My history in Web Development</h3>
                <p>I am currently progressing through a full-stack web development bootcamp through the University of
                    North Caroliina at Charlotte. During this bootcamp, I have developed numerous skills and learned to
                    apply them in real world situations. I've worked on projects independently, as well as with a team.
                </p>
                <h3>A few of my hobbies</h3>
                <p>Here's a lenghty paragraph about my hobbies.</p>
